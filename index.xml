      <description>Hugely inspired by Julia Evans and her writings, I (Dwarak Govind Parthiban) am trying to represent my learnings through my bytts. Primarily, the purpose is just to compile my learnings in a single place. Do read out the bytts that interests you.</description>

      <description>Computer Science is a vast vaaaast and an awesome aweeeesome area of study. I am interested in many of the domains that it offers. Some of them includes Algorithms, Operating Systems, Databases, Networks, Machine Learning, GPU Programming etc., Bytts are some of my writings on the areas that i am interested in. A Bytt could be a writing that explains a topic, a code snippet for a problem or random experiences that are related to Computer Science in one way or the other.</description>
