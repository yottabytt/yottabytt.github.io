      <description>Here  is the link to the actual paper.
Good to know Lucene, Item-Based Collaborative Filtering, Document Similarity, Multi-label text classification.
Gist Multiple topics are assigned to a document based on the topics of similar documents present in the corpus. The paper explains about various different approaches in the process of finding similar documents and in the selection of appropriate topics from the similar documents and assigning them to the input document.</description>

      <description>All of the below are completely, my personal views.
Ofcourse, you could be present amongst the crowd who view the universities just by their rankings. I am not at all against the rankings of the universities. But one must understand the process involved behind such rankings, the criteria considered in the course of ranking and so on. Few of the criteria, may not at all be applicable to you. So on choosing your list of universities, go a level above and look out for the criteria that you wish to be a part of your destination university.</description>

      <description>As of now, I have planned to present four kinds of bytts. They are, 
 Paper Bytts - Brief summaries of my learnings after reading research papers. Code Bytts - Solution programs and experimentation programs to a wide variety of CS problems. Topic Bytts - Explanation of some of the topics in CS that I am interested in. Random Bytts - Things that are related to CS but does not fall in the above categories.</description>

      <description>Hugely inspired by Julia Evans and her writings, I am trying to represent my learnings through my bytts. Primarily, the purpose is just to compile my learnings in a single place. Do read out the bytts that interests you.</description>

      <description>Computer Science is a vast vaaaast and an awesome aweeeesome area of study. I am interested in many of the domains that it offers. Some of my broader interest areas include Algorithms, Mathematics for Computer Science, Operating Systems, Parallel Computing and Artificial Intelligence. A Bytt could be a writing that explains a topic, a brief summary of a research paper, a code snippet for a problem or random experiences that are related to Computer Science in one way or the other.</description>
