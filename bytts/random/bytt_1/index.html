    Random Bytt #1 - Things to look for, while applying to a university for your Master&#39;s in Computer Science

            <div class="markdown">
                
    

<p><em>All of the below are completely, my personal views.</em></p>

<p>Ofcourse, you could be present amongst the crowd who view the universities just by their rankings. I am not at all against the rankings of the universities. But one must understand the process involved behind such rankings, the criteria considered in the course of ranking and so on. Few of the criteria, may not at all be applicable to you. So on choosing your list of universities, go a level above and look out for the criteria that you wish to be a part of your destination university.</p>

<p>To my understanding, the top 10 departments in the USA for CS remain almost the same in most of the rankings. The reason is, it is the truth. Those are the universities, which have an excellent faculty with a large number of people be it Professors, Researchers, PhD&rsquo;s, Post-docs working in almost all of the areas in Computer Science ranging from Theory to Systems to Artificial Intelligence and so on. But unfortunately, those universities cannot accomodate all those aspiring computer science undergrads across the globe. So, one must look for other options that are available for a great overall learning experience.</p>

<p>According to me, the first thing that one must think of is the kind of Master&rsquo;s that he/she wishes to pursue. There are three kinds of Master&rsquo;s degree offered by most of the universities across the globe, Master&rsquo;s by Thesis, Master&rsquo;s by Project and Professional Master&rsquo;s. I shall share my learnings about the first two.</p>

<ul>
<li>The project-based Master&rsquo;s would be an ideal option for people who wish to get a wider knowledge in different areas by taking a variety of graduate courses and who are not interested in research but wanted to learn more.</li>
<li>The thesis-based Master&rsquo;s would be an ideal option for people who wish to dive a little deep into one particular area and who wanted to experience how  research is, if they have not experienced it satisfactorily during their undergrad days.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now, coming to the things to look for,</p>

<h4 id="master-s-by-project">Master&rsquo;s by Project</h4>

<ul>
<li>Beware, your undergrad GPA is the strongest(relatively) selling point in your profile. Also, undergrad GPA is always correlated to your undergrad institution.
The lower the tier of your institution, the higher your GPA should be. Also, work experience per se do not matter.</li>
<li>As the world believes in the rankings of the universities according to few esteemed journals, articles and websites, you can also stick to it. One of the trusted website in the internet and even suggested by some professors is the <a href="https://www.usnews.com/education/best-global-universities/search?region=&amp;subject=computer-science">US News Global Ranking of Universities for CS</a>.</li>
<li>As you are expecting a wide variety of courses, have a look at the graduate course offerings in the recent years.</li>
<li>As you would be heading to the industry once you are done with your Master&rsquo;s, have a look at the places where the university&rsquo;s alumni work. LinkedIn&rsquo;s Alumni feature would be useful for this task.</li>
<li>Chances of getting RA/TA positions, other on-campus and off-campus jobs. You can have a word with people who are currently studying there.</li>
<li>Proximity to tech hubs. Though this may not matter a lot, but being nearer can make you get involved in a lot of activities which happen in such places.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="master-s-by-thesis">Master&rsquo;s by Thesis</h4>

<ul>
<li>At times, your low GPA could be compensated by having a prior research experience. Some of them include, published papers at top conferences, worked in research projects under renowned professors, worked in renowned academic/industrial R&amp;D labs.</li>
<li>Look for professors who are working in the areas/problems that you wish to work on. The match between your interest and the professors&rsquo; interest can be at different levels - <em>broader-area, area and problem</em>. The problem level matching is the perfect one. To know the level of matching, have a look at their works like research papers in the recent days, research projects, works done by others in the labs they are associated with etc.,</li>
<li>Look out for the recognition and the quality of research done by those professors. Have a look at <a href="http://csrankings.org/">CS Rankings based on research papers appeared at the most selective conferences</a>.</li>
<li>As you are expecting to work on a single problem for your thesis, have a look at the graduate course offerings in the recent years and ensure the availability of sufficient number of fundamental and advanced courses that could support your research.</li>
<li>Also, if possible, have a word with the professor and ensure whether he/she is looking for or ready to accept a Master&rsquo;s student.</li>
<li>Know about the working conditions with the professor, level of guidance and support he/she would provide, her/his professional and personal qualities etc., For this, have a word with current and past Master&rsquo;s and PhD students who have worked or working with the professor of your interest.</li>
<li>If you want to do a fully funded Master&rsquo;s, have a look at whether the university supports it. There are still a decent number of universities across the globe which provide guaranteed funding even for international students. Irrespective of the full funding, thesis admits at many universities receive partial funding through RA and TA positions.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="common">Common</h4>

<ul>
<li>Tuition fees and living expenses. Affordable education should be a priority.</li>
<li>Visa regulations present in the country where the university is located, if you are an international student.</li>
</ul>

<p>Master&rsquo;s in CS is mapped to the universities in the USA in the minds of many people. USA is undoubtedly the best choice, as there are a plenty of good schools. Likwewise, there are so many strong supporting reasons to it, which are known to many people, re-iterating them is out of scope for this bytt.</p>

<p>But, if you wish to pursue Master&rsquo;s by Thesis and are looking for a PhD in the future, you can always look for options other than the ones present in the USA. Some of my favourite, not too offbeat destination countries which have a handful of good to great CS schools are the UK, Germany, Scandinavian Countries, Switzerland, Singapore, Canada and Australia. For Indians, I would definitely add India to the above list. There are a few offbeat countries as well which includes China, Japan, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Israel, Malaysia and South Korea. But ensure that the medium of instruction is comfortable to you and the funding is decent.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>A special mention which I would like to add to the offbeat destinations is <a href="https://www.kaust.edu.sa/en/study">KAUST</a>, Saudi Arabia. One of the main reason is, they are just about to celebrate their 8th anniversary in the month of September, 2017. Yet, they have pulled brilliant professors and students successfully from all over the world. They are new, yet they are doing the right thing and the things that are needed and important.</em></p>
